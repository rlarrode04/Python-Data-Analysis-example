# Python-Data-Analysis-example
*Event logging* (EL) is used to track a variety of performance and usage metrics to help on the decision making process. Specifically, the most used metrics are:

- *clickthrough rate*: the proportion of search sessions where the user clicked on one of the results displayed
- *zero results rate*: the proportion of searches that yielded 0 results

and other metrics outside the scope of this task. EL uses JavaScript to asynchronously send messages (events) to the servers when the user has performed specific actions. In this task, you will analyze a subset of our event logs.

## Task

You must create a **reproducible report**\* answering the following questions:

1. What is the daily overall clickthrough rate? How does it vary between the groups?
2. Which results do people tend to try first? How does it change day-to-day?
3. What is the daily overall zero results rate? How does it vary between the groups?
4. Let *session length* be approximately the time between the first event and the last event in a session. Choose a variable from the dataset and describe its relationship to session length. Visualize the relationship.
5. Summarize your findings in an *executive summary*.
